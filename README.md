
### Show Folder Size (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

ShowFolderSize is a Java 1.4 console application to display the total size of
files in folders named on the command line, with or without subfolders
included. Redirect output to a text file, and save as CSV if desired
(comma-separated values).

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window.
